Symbolizing Data
================

In this tutorial, you will add a layer representing various cities on
earth. These cities will be represented on the map by small black circles.


Live Example
------------

The results should look the same as below, which is running from a live demo
server, with the data displayed in an `OpenLayers3 map
<http://openlayers.org/>`_

.. raw:: html
	:file: symbolizing.html


Symbols
-------

Your mapfile should look like that: :ref:`symbolizing.map <qs_symbolizing_map>`.

You can add the *places* layer as you added the other layers:

.. literalinclude:: symbolizing.map
   :language: mapfile
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: # START PLACES LAYER
   :end-before: # END PLACES LAYER

There are few differences with the previous layers:

- It is of type ``POINT``.
- In the ``STYLE`` object, we define which symbol to use, what its color will be
  and how it will be filled.

To make this layer work, you need to add at the top of the ``MAP`` object the
following ``SYMBOL`` object:

.. literalinclude:: symbolizing.map
   :language: mapfile
   :start-after: # START OF SYMBOL DEFINITION
   :end-before: # END OF SYMBOL
   :dedent: 4

You give a name to the symbol so it can be used in any ``STYLE`` object. You
must also give a ``TYPE`` to the symbol. This ``TYPE`` defines how the symbol
will be rendered with the ``POINTS`` section.

The ``FILLED`` attribute defines whether the symbol can be filled by a ``COLOR``
attribute in a ``LAYER``.
