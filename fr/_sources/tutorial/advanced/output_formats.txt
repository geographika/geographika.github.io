Output Formats
=======================

..
   The keyword IMAGETYPE is used to define which image format the
   MapServer CGI program should use for output. In this case we are
   using indexed color PNG (similar to GIF). This could be GIF, if we
   compiled the GD library with GIF support, WBMP, or JPEG. We can
   also specify other output options (PDF, SWF, GeoTIFF) provided that
   we compiled support for them and specify them with the OUTPUTFORMAT
   object. The OUTPUTFORMAT goes beyond the scope of this tutorial but
   you can find out more about by reading through documentations in
   the MapServer web site.
