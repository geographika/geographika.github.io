This tutorial was design to help new users start quickly with MapServer 7.0 and
6.4. You should follow the order of the sections since they are sorted by
difficulty and each section is built on the previous one. Each section presents
a feature of MapServer, a MapFile illustrating the use of the feature and a
small embed demonstration to show you how the result must look like.

If you want to test the demo on your server, you'll need:

- A working installation of MapServer. Go to the :ref:`installation section
  <installation>` of the documentation to find out how to do that.
- Data which can be found `here
  <https://github.com/gislars/mapserver-tutorial-data>`__.
