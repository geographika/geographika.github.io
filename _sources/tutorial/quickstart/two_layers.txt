A Map with Two Layers
=====================

This second tutorial explains how to add a layer to your mapfile. We will use a
polygon shapefile displaying the world's landmass and a polygon shapefile
displaying the oceans.

Live Example
------------

Once you have successfully configured your MapServer you can update the two text boxes
below with your own webserver address, and path to your mapfile.

The results should look the same as below, which is running from a live demo server, with
the data displayed in an `OpenLayers3 map <http://openlayers.org/>`_

.. raw:: html
	:file: two_layers.html


Adding a layer
--------------

This is what the mapfile looks like: :ref:`two_layers.map <qs_two_layers_map>`.

To add a layer, you must add a ``LAYER`` object to the ``MAP`` object. Each
layer object must have:

- a unique ``NAME`` attribute.
- a ``PROJECTION`` object that tells MapServer in which projection the data is
  so it can draw it correctly. If the data is in the same projection as the map object's
  projection then you do not need to set it on the layer. 
- a ``DATA`` attribute which value is the path to the shapefile you want to use.
- a ``CLASS`` object which describes how the data should be rendered.

To add the ocean layer, append the following lines to the map object:

.. literalinclude:: two_layers.map
   :language: mapfile
   :start-after: # START OCEAN LAYER
   :end-before: # END OCEAN LAYER
   :dedent: 4
