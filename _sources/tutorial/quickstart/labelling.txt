Labelling Data
==============

In this tutorial, you will add a label with the name of the city to the *places*
layer. You added this layer in the :ref:`previous tutorial <qs_symbolizing>` and
each cities is represented by a black dot.


Live Example
------------

The results should look the same as below, which is running from a live demo server, with
the data displayed in an `OpenLayers3 map <http://openlayers.org/>`_

.. raw:: html
	:file: labelling.html


Labels
------

Your mapfile should look like that: :ref:`labelling.map <qs_labelling_map>`.

First you need to specify to MapServer how to find the fonts. To do that, add to
the ``MAP`` object:

.. code-block:: mapfile

   FONTSET 'fonts.txt'

The ``fonts.txt`` file contains the location of each fonts you can use for your
labels. It consists of two columns: on the left column, there is the name of the
font. You must use this name in your mapfile to use a font. In the second
column, you have the path to the font (in TTF format) on your drive.

Then you need to add a ``LABEL`` object in the ``CLASS`` object of the *places*
layer:

.. literalinclude:: labelling.map
   :language: mapfile
   :start-after: # START LABEL
   :end-before: # END LABEL
   :dedent: 12

The ``POSITION`` parameter can be used to define the position of the
label. Without it, the label will be at the exact location of the city. This
means, the label will be over the dot which is not really readable. Thankfully,
MapServer can position label automatically with the ``AUTO`` parameter so this
won't happen. You can of course position the labels manually.
