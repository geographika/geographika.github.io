============================
Symbols and Symbolizing Data
============================

In this tutorial, you will see some more options on symbolizing MapServer layers. We 
previously looked at :ref:`STYLE` and set colors and line thicknesses. In this tutorial we will 
be using :ref:`SYMBOL`. These are shapes and signs that can be used to display data in different ways, 
often symbols are shared between different mapfiles and projects.  

The first symbol is a simple circle. Symbols require a ``NAME`` attribute, 
so they can be referred to elsewhere in the mapfile. Its type here is ``ellipse``. The ``POINTS`` property
defines the X and Y radius of the ellipse. In this case both are set to 1, which produces a circle
rather than an ellipse. The ``FILLED`` property means it is a solid circle, rather than a hollow
outline. 

.. literalinclude:: mapfiles/symbolizing.map
   :language: mapfile
   :start-after: # START OF CIRCLE SYMBOL
   :end-before: # END OF CIRCLE SYMBOL
   :dedent: 4

The second symbol is a based on an image file. Its type is ``pixmap`` - 
which means it is simply a small raster image. The image file needs to be stored locally, 
and can be either a PNG or GIF. 
   
.. literalinclude:: mapfiles/symbolizing.map
   :language: mapfile
   :start-after: # START OF IMAGE SYMBOL
   :end-before: # END OF IMAGE SYMBOL 
   :dedent: 4   

The final symbol used is a ``vector`` symbol. This again uses a ``POINTS`` property which 
can be used to create any shape. Here we create an inverted V shape. When this is used to fill 
in a polygon feature it looks like a wave. 

.. literalinclude:: mapfiles/symbolizing.map
   :language: mapfile
   :start-after: # START OF POLYGON FILL SYMBOL
   :end-before: # END OF POLYGON FILL SYMBOL   
   :dedent: 4
    
The remaining symbol types ``hatch``, ``svg``, and ``truetype`` (fonts) are not demonstrated here. 

Example
-------

You should be able to use the appropriate HTML and mapfiles to create the example below using your local
MapServer. 

.. raw:: html
	:file: htmlfiles/symbolizing.html

OpenLayer is drawing a single combined image containing all the layers in the map. You can right-click on the image
to save it locally. 

Switching Styles
----------------

Your mapfile should look like the one here - :ref:`symbolizing.map <qs_symbolizing_map>`.
There are three layers in the mapfile - land, ocean, and places. 

Each layer has two classes. This allows each layer to be represented in two different ways. 
Let's look at the layer configuration for places below:

.. literalinclude:: mapfiles/symbolizing.map
   :language: mapfile
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: # START PLACES LAYER
   :end-before: # END PLACES LAYER

The :ref:`CLASSGROUP` keyword defines which of the classes to use. Each :ref:`CLASS` has a ``GROUP``
parameter. When this matches the ``CLASSGROUP`` it will be used to style the layer. If no ``CLASSGROUP`` is 
set, then the first ``CLASS`` defined in the layer will be used. 

The client application, in this case OpenLayers, can change the setting for ``CLASSGROUP`` via
the querystring. This is done using the ``STYLES`` option of the WMS GetMap request. When you click on the radio
buttons above the querystring sent to MapServer includes the three layers to display in the image
as well as the three styles to apply to the layers. 

The order of style names matches the order of layer names in the ``LAYERS`` parameter: 

.. code:: bat

	?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=ocean,land,places&STYLES=style1,style1,style1
	?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=ocean,land,places&STYLES=style2,style2,style2

If no styles are sent in the URL, then the default style for the layer specified in ``CLASSGROUP``
will be used.
