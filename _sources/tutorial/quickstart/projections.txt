Projections
==================

Your mapfile should look like the one here - :ref:`symbolizing.map <qs_symbolizing_map>`.

http://epsg.io/

Projections are stored in ``C:\ms4w\proj\nad``

Link to http://www.mapserver.org/mapfile/projection.html

Only EPSG, AUTO2, CRS currently supported

Mollweide: a global map projection that preserves areas, often used in the sciences for depicting global distributions on small maps.

Robinson projection not supported in proj4js - https://github.com/proj4js/proj4js/issues/161
Can see main ones in https://github.com/proj4js/proj4js/tree/master/lib/projections

Example
-------

You should be able to use the appropriate HTML and mapfiles to create the example below using your local
MapServer. 

.. raw:: html
	:file: htmlfiles/projections.html

..
   This needs to be in the same
   units as the data or, if specifying a different output projection,
   in the same units as the output projection.

   You can use the utility `ogrinfo
   <http://gdal.osgeo.org/ogr_utilities.html>`_, which is part of the
   GDAL/OGR library package, to get the extent of a particular
   Shapefile dataset (or other supported vector formats).  Here is the
   command I used to get the extent for this example::

     ogrinfo -al -so states_ugl.shp

   This returned the following output::

     INFO: Open of `states_ugl.shp' using driver `ESRI Shapefile' successful.
     Layer name: states_ugl
     Geometry: Polygon
     Feature Count: 204
     Extent: (-97.238976, 41.619778) - (-82.122902, 49.385620)
     Layer SRS WKT:(unknown)
     AREA: Real (12.3)
     PERIMETER: Real (12.3)
     STATESP020: Real (11.0)STATE: String (20.0)
     STATE_FIPS: String (2.0)
     CLASS: String (5.0)

   You can also use ArcView or an open source GIS packages--QGIS,
   Thuban, etc.

   Feel free to change the values of EXTENT to get a better
   understanding of how it changes your map.
