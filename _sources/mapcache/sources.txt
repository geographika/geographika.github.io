MapCache uses the concept of a "source" as a service that is able to return
image data given a set of parameters (namely an extent, an image size, and a
projection). Typically, a source is the third-party WMS server that you want
to put a tile cache in front of.

WMS Sources
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A WMS server is the main upstream server type used by MapCache. When processing a
given tile, if it is not found in its cache, MapCache will query a WMS server with
a GetMap request, split the returned image data into individual tiles, and store
those tiles in its cache for subsequent requests.



.. code-block:: xml

  <source name="mywmsserver" type="wms">
    <http> .... </http>
    <getmap>
      <params>
        <map>/path/to/mapserver/mapfile.map</map>
        <layers>value2</layers>
      </params>
    </getmap>
  </source>


.. seealso:: :ref:`mapcache_http` to configure how the `<http>` block should be expressed

.. warning:: You should usually only supply vendor-specific parameters to the
             `<params>` block.  **Never** include any hardcoded BBOX, WIDTH, HEIGHT, SRS or
             any parameters related to dimensions inside this block, as these are calculated
             by MapCache itself at runtime.
